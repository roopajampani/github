Self-service?\n\u2022 Atmosphere: What type of atmosphere do you want your establishment to hold?\nDo you want to open a casual, self-service cafe? Or a fine-dining, high-end\nrestaurant?\n"

What works and what doesn\u2019t? You\u2019ll need to be able to compete with\nthese establishments, so take on board what they\u2019re already doing and better it.\nBe aware of the type of your establishment and the number of similar restaurants in\nthe area you are looking to open it. If there is already a lot of them, chances are you\u2019re\nentering business in an over-saturated area and the potential for you to succeed\nquickly may be diminished. Consider opening in an area where there is a gap in the\nmarket and demand for your service. However, you must also consider the opposing. If\nthere are no restaurants in the area similar to your concept, why? It could simply be\nthat nobody has followed that path yet, or because it will not work.
